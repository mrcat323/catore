# catore - the web store
## now **catore** became an open source project!

while I was busy with creating [catoolin](https://github.com/eazy-english/catoolin) one always thought, what should I create with this, for practice and finally decided to create this project.

> Honestly, it's my first web store project, I didn't know how to create, but with logic thinking I finally did it. - Mr. CaT.

# [DEMO](http://catore.tk)
**If you want to see it before getting the source code, here is the [demo](http://catore.tk/)**
It's **OFFICIALLY** *Open Source project*

## P.S: It was created with CATOOLIN v1.0.0

***With Respect Mr. CaT***
